# Emotion-based-music-recommender
This Streamlit web application is designed to recommend songs on YouTube based on the user's current emotion or mood.

The project aims to detect emojis in real-time video feeds by extracting facial features and predicting the corresponding emojis and then recommend songs to the user on the basis of their mood. 

It uses the MediaPipe library for landmark detection and OpenCV for video processing.


<h5>Overall, the application combines real-time emotion detection, machine learning-based inference, and web browser integration to provide personalized music recommendations tailored to the user's mood.</h5>
